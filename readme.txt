Block for preparing roleplaying game sessions using the Lazy DM method from Mike Shea (more info here: https://slyflourish.com/)

== Description ==

Preparing an excellent roleplaying session is challenging and time-consuming. So many things to do upfront that your players don't have to worry about. It's fair that you can spend as little preparing the session as you want.

Mike Shea created a method to prepare a complete 4 hours game session in 30 minutes or less: The Lazy DM method. This method considers the essential elements that make for an excellent roleplaying session (like secrets and clues and fantastic locations, among others) and gives you a comprehensive checklist to prepare it in record time.
